You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* I didn't know the tag "<sup>". And I'd forgot the tag "<strike>".
In addition, I had to arrange the font family by myself.

* The layout itself was very simple and didn't give me any troubles.

* Fortunately, I haven't found any difficulties in terms of this project so far.

* I kept relaxing and consulted MDN page each time when I was not sure of what I was writing.
